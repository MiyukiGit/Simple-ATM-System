# Simple Calculator (C++)

This is a **simple calculator program written in C++**.
I made this project to practice basic C++ programming and understand how input, output, and logic work in a console application.

What This Program Can Do

* Add two numbers
* Subtract two numbers
* Multiply two numbers
* Divide two numbers
* Runs in the terminal

Why I Made This

I am still learning C++, and this project helped me practice:

* `cin` and `cout`
* `if-else` or `switch` statements
* Functions
* Basic problem solving

Example Output


Enter first number: 8
Enter second number: 4
Choose operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide

Result: 12

Things to Improve Later

* Make a version using classes


## Notes

This is a **beginner project**, so the code is kept simple and easy to understand.
I plan to improve it as I learn more about C++.


* Make it sound **even more casual**
* Add a **student bio section**
* Match it exactly to **how your code works** (loop / no loop / function / no function)

Just tell me 😄
