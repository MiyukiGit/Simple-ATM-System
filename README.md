# Simple Calculator (C++)

This is a **simple calculator program written in C++**.
I made this project to practice basic C++ programming and understand how input, output, and logic work in a console application.

What This Program Can Do

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Prevents division by zero
- Allows the user to calculate again using a loop
  
How the Program Works

The user enters two numbers
The user chooses an operation (+, -, *, /)
The program displays the result
The user can choose whether to calculate again or exit
Why I Made This

I am still learning C++, and this project helped me practice:

* `cin` and `cout`
* `if-else` or `switch` statements
* Functions
* Basic problem solving

Example Output 
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter your second number: 2
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): /
Result: 5

Do you want to calculate again? (y/n): y
```


Things to Improve Later

* Make a version using classes


## Notes

This is a **beginner project**, so the code is kept simple and easy to understand.
I plan to improve it as I learn more about C++.
